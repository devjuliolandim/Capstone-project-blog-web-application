    <hr>

    <p>Backend is a fundamental part of software development, especially in web applications. It refers to the layer of a system that handles data processing and storage, as well as business logic. While the frontend deals with the user interface and direct user interaction, the backend deals with everything that happens behind the scenes.</p>

    <h3>Typical responsibilities of the backend include:</h3>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Database Management:</strong> Interacting with the database to store, retrieve, and modify data as required by the application.</li>
        <li><strong>Business Logic</strong>: Implementing the rules and business processes that govern the application's behavior.</li>
        <li><strong>Security:</strong> Implementing security measures to protect data and ensure that the application is resilient to attacks.</li>
        <li><strong>Integration:</strong> Connecting to external services, APIs, and other systems to obtain or send data.</li>
        <li><strong>API Development:</strong> Creating application programming interfaces that allow the frontend and other applications to communicate with the backend.</li>
        <li><strong>Scalability and Performance:</strong> Ensuring that the application can handle a large volume of traffic and continue to function efficiently.</li>
    </ul>
