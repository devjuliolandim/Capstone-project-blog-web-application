        <p>Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It was originally developed by Sun Microsystems, which is now a part of Oracle Corporation. Java is known for its portability across platforms, meaning that programs written in Java can run on any device that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM).</p>

    <h3>Key Features of Java:</h3>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Platform Independence:</strong> Java code is compiled into an intermediate form called bytecode, which can be executed on any device equipped with a JVM. This "write once, run anywhere" capability is a significant advantage.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Object-Oriented:</strong> Java is built around the concept of objects. This allows developers to create modular programs and reusable code. Key concepts include classes, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Robust and Secure:</strong> Java includes strong memory management, exception handling, and type checking at compile time. It also includes security features such as bytecode verification and a security manager that allows applications to define security policies.</li>
        <li><strong>Simple and Familiar Syntax:</strong> Java's syntax is influenced by C and C++, making it relatively easy to learn for those familiar with these languages. However, it omits many complex and error-prone features of C++, such as pointers and multiple inheritance.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Multithreaded:</strong> Java supports multithreading, which allows multiple threads to run concurrently, enabling the development of interactive and high-performance applications.</li>
        <li><strong>Rich Standard Library:</strong> Java comes with an extensive standard library that provides many utilities and frameworks for common tasks, such as data structures, networking, database access, and graphical user interface (GUI) development.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Java Development Components</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Java Development Kit (JDK): The JDK is a software development kit used to develop Java applications. It includes the Java Runtime Environment (JRE), an interpreter/loader (Java), a compiler (javac), an archiver (jar), a documentation generator (Javadoc), and other tools needed for Java development.</li>
        <li>Java Runtime Environment (JRE): The JRE provides libraries, the JVM, and other components necessary to run applications written in Java. It does not contain tools for Java development, such as compilers or debuggers.</li>
        <li>Java Virtual Machine (JVM): The JVM is an abstract computing machine that enables a computer to run a Java program. It provides the necessary environment for Java bytecode to be executed, which includes memory management and garbage collection.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Java Editions</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>Java SE (Standard Edition): This is the core Java platform used for developing desktop applications and server environments. It includes the JDK, JVM, and a set of libraries.</li>
        <li>Java EE (Enterprise Edition): Built on top of Java SE, Java EE provides an API and runtime environment for developing and running large-scale, multi-tiered, scalable, and secure network applications. It includes additional libraries for database access, web services, and more.</li>
        <li>Java ME (Micro Edition): This edition is designed for embedded systems and mobile devices, offering a subset of the features of Java SE.</li>
    </ul>


    <h3>Example of Java Code</h3>
    <p>Here is a simple example of a Java program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console:</p>

    <div class="code">
        <div class="code-header">Java Code:</div>
        <div class="code-itself"><pre><code> public class HelloWorld { 
    public static void main(String[] args) { 
        System.out.println("Hello, World!"); 
    }
}</code>
        </pre></div>
    </div>

    <h3>Use Cases</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Web Applications: Java is widely used for building server-side applications using Java EE.</li>
        <li>Mobile Applications: Android development primarily uses Java (although Kotlin is also widely used now).</li>
        <li>Desktop GUI Applications: Applications using frameworks such as Swing and JavaFX.</li>
        <li>Enterprise Solutions: Large-scale applications using frameworks like Spring.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Community and Ecosystem</h3>
    <p style="width: 65%;">Java has a large and active community, extensive documentation, numerous open-source libraries, and frameworks, making it a versatile and powerful choice for many types of software development projects.</p>
